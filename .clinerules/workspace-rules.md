# Project & task planning guidelines

## CLI & tool calling
- The CLI interface being used is git bash.

## Workspace navigation
- Start each task by reading the VSCode workspace file. It's location is stored inside the env var HARMONY_AI_VSC_WORKSPACE_FILE.
- If the env var is not set or the workspace file is unavailable, always ask for its location.
- The VSCode workspace file contains paths to folders and repos which may be relevant for the current task.
- Relative paths in the workspace file are always relative to the Workspace file location.
- If a repo mentioned in the task description is located in a different folder than the current working dir, ask for permission to read the directory of the repo that's required for the task. 
- In case a project or module that is being referenced in the instruction is not part of the workspace file, ask for guidance.

## Memory Bank usage
- A folder or repository referenced in the VSCode workspace file may have it's own memory bank with context about itself and it's role within the project, located in a folder named memory-bank. 
  - Examples:
    - Harmony Link: harmony-link/memory-bank
    - VNGE-Plugin: vnge-harmony-link-plugin/memory-bank
    - etc.
- When evaluating a task, always read the memory bank of the base repo and the repository that is part of the task you're currently working on, so you're up to date. So if we work on the VNGE plugin for example, you need to check the memory bank of both harmony link and the VNGE Plugin.
- When updating the memory bank, always inspect the memory banks of all repositories which have been touched while working on the task whether updates are needed.
- When updating the memory bank, if `.toon` files exist, these should be checked for requiring an update first, and be updated prior to the markdown files.
- When updating the memory bank, also check whether the docs and changelog of the repository require updates.


# Task execution guidelines

## Agent editing rules
- If multiple files have similar naming, make sure to always re-read a file before an edit, so you have the correct content.

# Building the project
- Do not attempt to build the project to test for compilation issues.
- Unless you've been told otherwise, building and Tests will be performed manually after fully finishing the task.

## Handling of Compile errors while in the middle of a task
- Sometimes the changes after an edit can cause the IDE to show compile or import errors
- Before fixing intermediate errors, continue with the initial task.
- If you're done with the implementation of the main task and there are errors remaining, think of possible options to solve them.
- Always design a solution path and ask for confirmation before applying a fix, even if in PLAN mode.

## Documentation Requirements
- Update relevant documentation in /docs when modifying features
- Keep README.md in sync with new capabilities
- Maintain changelog entries in CHANGELOG.md for changes which are relevant for users.
- Do not include implementation details like names of constants or code files in the changelog.
