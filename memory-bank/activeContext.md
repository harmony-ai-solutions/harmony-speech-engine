## Active Technical Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

**Request Processing Model**
- **Decision**: Per-request processing instead of token sequence batching
- **Rationale**: Speech processing requires complete audio/text inputs, unlike incremental token generation
- **Impact**: Simplified request handling but requires different optimization strategies

**Multi-Model Orchestration**
- **Decision**: Intelligent request routing with automatic model selection
- **Rationale**: Enables complex workflows without user knowledge of internal model architecture
- **Impact**: Increased system complexity but significantly improved user experience

**Executor Architecture**
- **Decision**: Separate CPU and GPU executors with parallel execution
- **Rationale**: Optimal resource utilization and support for mixed deployment scenarios
- **Impact**: Better performance but increased architectural complexity

### Technology Choices

**FastAPI for API Layer**
- **Decision**: FastAPI over Flask or Django
- **Rationale**: Automatic OpenAPI generation, async support, and modern Python features
- **Impact**: Excellent developer experience and documentation generation

**React + Vite for Frontend**
- **Decision**: React with Vite instead of traditional webpack setup
- **Rationale**: Fast development server, modern build tooling, and excellent TypeScript support
- **Impact**: Improved development velocity and build performance

**Docker-First Deployment**
- **Decision**: Primary focus on Docker containerization
- **Rationale**: Consistent deployment across different environments and simplified dependency management
- **Impact**: Easier deployment but requires Docker knowledge from users

## Current Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Model Memory Management

**Problem**: Large models consume significant GPU/CPU memory, limiting concurrent model loading
**Current Approach**: Lazy loading and model sharing across requests
**Planned Solution**: Implement model unloading based on usage patterns and memory pressure

### Challenge 2: Complex Workflow Debugging

**Problem**: Multi-step processing pipelines are difficult to debug when failures occur
**Current Approach**: Comprehensive request status tracking and logging
**Planned Solution**: Enhanced debugging interface with step-by-step execution visibility

### Challenge 3: Performance Optimization

**Problem**: Balancing quality and speed for real-time applications
**Current Approach**: Configurable model selection and batch processing
**Planned Solution**: Adaptive quality settings and streaming capabilities

### Challenge 4: Model Integration Complexity

**Problem**: Each new model requires significant integration effort
**Current Approach**: Standardized model configuration and loading patterns
**Planned Solution**: Plugin architecture for community-contributed models
